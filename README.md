<p>In the register section it will ask for 3 fields, name, email and password (the email has a format that must be fulfilled), once registered the system will automatically provide you with a user name.</p>
<p>In the login section the system will ask for your email and password to enter the system.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Buy cryptos on exchange: </b>This option is used to buy cryptos directly from the exchange (The amount must be greater than 0 but there is a limit of cryptos on the exchange, and you must have the amount of fiat in your account).</li>
  <li><b>Place buy Order: </b>This option is used to create a purchase order in which we will select the type of cryptocurrency, the amount and the maximum price we are willing to pay (If the user does not have enough fiat he/she will not be able to create the purchase order)</li>
  <li><b>Place sell order: </b>This option is used to create a sell order in which we will select the type of cryptocurrency, the amount and the maximum price we are willing to pay (If the user does not have enough crypti, he/she will not be able to create the sell order).</li>
</ul>
